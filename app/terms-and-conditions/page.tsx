        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          These Booking Terms &amp; Conditions and the General Booking Information contained on our web
          site will form the basis of your agreement with Sojourn Cabins ("the Company"). They apply
          only to holiday arrangements which you book with us and which we agree to make, provide or
          perform as applicable as part of our agreement with you and no other third party. This
          Agreement shall be governed and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of
          Ghana. The parties hereto submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ghanaian Courts.
        </p>

        <h3>Contract</h3>
        <p>
          A contract only exists between Sojourn Cabins ("we/our/us") and the "clients" from the time
          a Confirmation Invoice is dispatched / received and a payment must be made by the available
          means on our payment portal.
        </p>

        <h3>Booking Form</h3>
        <p>
          To make a booking with Sojourn Cabins a Booking Form will need to be completed accurately at{' '}
          <a href="https://sojourngh.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sojourngh.com</a> and submitted.
          In the event a booking is made without completing a Booking Form, for instance a telephone
          booking, it is a condition that the information is accurately given. A telephone booking is a
          contract between us and the "clients" from the time a Confirmation/Invoice is dispatched when
          Credit Card / Debit details will be required. We require full payment before a booking will be
          completed. Until that time no contract or agreement will be considered to exist between us. On
          all bookings a damage deposit is required.
        </p>

        <h3>Party Leader and Group Composition</h3>
        <p>
          The Party Leader is the person or agency who holds the booking, to whom all correspondence and
          invoices are addressed and who is responsible for the rental. Spouses' names are not considered
          interchangeable. Accommodation is provided only for the number of guests shown on the booking
          form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any additional persons wishing to book are required to notify us, as soon as possible and make
          confirmation in writing with any payment due immediately, unless we advise otherwise, but no
          later than 8 working days before departure or we reserve the right to refuse any such persons
          and may cancel the booking.
        </p>
        <p>
          No persons other than those stated on the Booking Form or accepted at such later date by
          Sojourn Cabins as additional persons shall be entitled to utilise and have the benefit of the
          accommodation and facilities of the property. The number of people staying in the cabin must
          not exceed the maximum number as shown in our website. Sojourn Cabins will ask any person to
          leave the assigned cabin in a case of non-compliance. Subletting, sharing or assigning the
          accommodation is prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that a person not named on the Booking Form or accepted as an additional person is
          deemed by us as agents as utilising the accommodation and facilities, we reserve the right to
          raise an additional charge for such accommodation etc, which shall be the joint and several
          liability of the clients. Additionally, should any activity or large gathering of people other
          than those noted on our invoice take place (e.g. party, wedding reception) we must be informed
          about it at the time of booking or through any of our Representatives beforehand. You will be
          charged an extra cost for cleaning / maid service / chef surcharge and a further security
          deposit may apply. Our cabins are let for holiday purposes only and commercial activities may
          only be carried out with our prior knowledge and or written approval on our invoice. This extra
          charge varies depending on the property and can be deducted from your credit or debit card
          without further notice.
        </p>

        <h3>Rental Period</h3>
        <p>
          All rental periods are indicated on your final invoice. Prices shown on our website refer to
          one night rental period. We do not accept bookings that go beyond 7 days at a time. The rental

        <h3>Price Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have made a booking and made all relevant payments, paid a deposit, we guarantee that
          the cost of your holiday will not change, no matter what happens to exchange rates or aviation
          fuel costs. The only exception is Government imposed cost increases such as VAT.
        </p>

        <h3>Holiday Pack</h3>
        <p>
          The Holiday Pack includes all vouchers, list of Extra Services requested, driving directions,
          contact names and telephone numbers, useful information. The Holiday Pack will be provided once
          the fully completed Booking Form and the total Invoice Price have been received. The Holiday
          Pack will not be issued if essential information, including group composition, is missing in the
          Booking Form. Errors or omissions in the Holiday Pack must be noted and conveyed to us
          immediately.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Booklet</h3>
        <p>
          Please note that the information contained in our Information Booklet is to be considered only
          as an indication. The information contained in the Information Booklet was accurate at the time
          of publication and made in good faith. Please check the Invoice and our website as changes might
          occur and updated information are posted on our website.
        </p>

        <h3>Damage Deposit &amp; Breakages</h3>
        <p>
          On all bookings we will require a damage deposit and this amount will vary from property to
          property. Any damage caused by clients, or by any third party invited by our clients to the
          accommodation, shall be the joint and sole liability of the clients that made said booking.
          Liability under this clause shall be the cost of replacement and/or reinstatement, which will be
          deducted from the breakage deposit. Should the amount of breakages/damages costs exceed the
          amount of the deposit, an invoice for these costs together with any administrative charge and/or
          legal expenses incurred will be raised. Failure to pay any costs of damages that have exceeded
          the amount of the original damage deposit will result in your details being forwarded to a debt
          collection agency and an extra fee of $50 be applied to the outstanding amount. Delivery of our
          invoice representing the costs of replacement and/or reinstatement shall be deemed to be
          accepted by the clients as their liability to us under this clause.
        </p>
        <p>
          When final payment is made by debit/credit card, we will have authority to deduct up to the
          value of that replacement and/or reinstatement through / via the account holder's debit/credit
          card, should breakages/damages occur during the client's occupation of their property. Clients
          who do not pay by credit/debit card must send a cheque/transfer to cover the damage deposit or
          by way of CREDIT CARD PRE-AUTHORISATION. The balance of any such deposits less the charge for
          damages will be returned to the client no later than 14 days from the date of departure.
        </p>

        <h4>Credit Card Pre-Authorisation Damage Policy</h4>
        <p>
          This is a temporary hold on a specified amount against damages from the available funds on your
          payment card*. Please note - this is not an actual charged amount and no funds are taken. Your
          payment card issuer may present a pre-authorisation as a pending transaction. This amount will
          vary from cabin to cabin and from booking to booking depending on party size and make up with
          their final payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you complete your rental and confirmation of no damages has been received by Sojourn Cabins
          the pre-authorisation funds will be released by your card issuer. Depending on your card issuer,
          it can take up to 14 working days before this is reflected in your account balance.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Even though a pre-authorisation is not an actual charge, it can temporarily reduce the
            available balance on your payment card; it also does not accrue interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately if we do not receive your Pre-Authorisation of your damage deposit prior to your
            departure, clients will not be able to have access to the property.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Bill / Check Out</h3>
        <p>
          The Final Bill is completed by the owner/caretaker. Details of any additional charges such as:
          Extra Services arranged locally; repairs required as a result of damages caused by the rental
          party. The Final Bill is presented by the owner/caretaker at the conclusion of the rental period
          and is payable to him/her in USD or GHS equivalent (cash or debit credit card as indicated on
          our website). Both the Party Leader and the caretaker are required to sign the Final Bill. The
          amount of the final bill will be invoiced in USD using the market exchange rates at the time of
          payment. Invoices for any outstanding items will be forwarded to the client as soon as they are
          received.
        </p>

        <h3>Cabin Information Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
          Ensuring our website is accurate is as important to us as it is to our clients. We, however,
          cannot accept liability for any loss whatsoever and howsoever arising due to any mis-description
          within the website due to circumstances which are beyond our control or supervision. There may
          be occasions when facilities are not available, i.e. a blocked toilet, water heaters and
          swimming pools may need maintenance, filters changed and there may be water/power shortages at
          periods of high demand. Government authorities may give permission for services to be
          stopped/turned off, without prior warning, so that a particular job/repair can be carried out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not warrant and are in no way responsible for the accuracy of any information given or
          statement made by our servants or agents or made by travel services other than those contained
          within the website. An area described as peaceful/quiet may have barking dogs, noisy neighbours,
          ants or mosquitoes, etc, at the time of your holiday. Unfortunately for these and other
          circumstances out of our control, we cannot be held responsible though our Representatives will
          do whatever they can to help. If we do not explicitly advertise the availability of an amenity
          we cannot be held liable for its availability when guest arrives. We may not be held liable for
          the loss of provision of these services in the case of technical issues or should services be
          withdrawn by the provider for any reason.
        </p>

        <h3>If You Cancel or Change Your Holiday</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to cancel the entire holiday, you must send us a cancellation instruction via email
          using the same email address provided during the booking. Cancellation takes effect on the date
          we receive your email. If you fail to make payments to us in accordance with these Booking
          Conditions we may treat this as a cancellation by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you cancel your holiday at any time after your booking has been accepted by us, then you must
          pay us a charge to compensate us for the expense and losses which we will incur as a result of
          your cancellation. The closer your cancellation is to the departure date, the less likelihood
          there is of us being able to recover those costs by re-selling the holiday at the website price.
          For this reason our cancellation charges increase the closer the cancellation is to the departure
          date. If you have to cancel for a reason covered by your insurance policy you should be able to
          recover cancellation charges.
        </p>
        <p>The cancellation charges are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free cancellation (less any transaction costs) if cancelled more than 2 weeks prior to check in;</li>
          <li>7–14 days prior to check in date — refund 50% (less any transaction costs) of total invoice value;</li>
          <li>0–6 days prior to check in date — No refund.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If, you wish to change your travel arrangements in any way once a binding contract is in place
          between us (for example your chosen departure date or accommodation) we will do our utmost to
          make these changes but it may not always be possible and the change cannot be less than the
          value of the original booking. Once deposits have been paid and you wish to change accommodation
          we will treat this as a new booking. If we can re-book previous accommodation for the same dates
          then it may be possible to reimburse part of your original deposit. Any request for changes to be
          made must be done via email from the person who made the booking. Where we can meet a request,
          all changes will be subject to payment of an administration fee based on our increased costs as a
          result of applicable rate changes and any costs or charges incurred or imposed by any of our
          suppliers. The amount of the fee will be notified to you before you choose to proceed with any
          change. If you make a number of changes to the same booking, we will only make a reasonable
          overall charge. You should be aware that these costs could increase the closer to the departure
          date that changes are made and you should contact us as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>If We Change or Cancel Your Holiday</h3>
        <p>
          From time to time it may be necessary for us to make changes to or to cancel your holiday after
          we have accepted your booking and we reserve the right to do so. Most changes are minor and in
          all cases we will tell you as soon as reasonably possible before the date on which you are due
          to depart. Occasionally we may need to make a major change. If we do, you must let us know
          within seven working days if you wish to accept the change or cancel the holiday with a full
          refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we have accepted your booking and we have to cancel it before it is due to start, for any
          reason other than your fault, or where you cancel the holiday because you do not wish to accept
          a major change by us, you can then either: (a) accept our offer of a replacement cabin, of a
          lower quality from the Sojourn Cabins portfolio only (if available) and we will refund the
          difference in the cost; or (b) accept our offer of a replacement cabin of equivalent or higher
          quality from the Sojourn Cabins portfolio only (if available); or (c) We will refund the money
          you have paid deposit / balance which will terminate the booking and our liability of any claims
          relating to that booking and/or compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at all times, without liability, to cancel or terminate a booking in the
          event that the Booking Form is not fully and/or accurately completed, at the time of the booking
          or later. This would also apply if a booking is made without completing a Booking Form and the
          information given is not accurate. If we have cause to rely upon this clause, we will not be
          liable to refund deposits paid. We will not pay you compensation or interest where we make a
          major change or cancel or in the event that we are forced to make a change or cancel as a result
          of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which we
          could not have avoided even with all due care. The above sets out the maximum extent of our
          liability for changes and cancellations and we regret we cannot meet any expenses or losses you
          may incur as a result of change or cancellation.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Arrivals &amp; Accommodation Change</h3>
        <p>
          We do not offer a meet and greet service at the airport or the property, however if you
          encounter any problems our emergency service may be contacted via the contact details provided
          with your documents. If you have booked transfers with us, the driver will be waiting at the
          airport with a board displaying your name.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will endeavour to have the cabin fully cleaned and ready for you on the day of your arrival.
          We receive many requests asking for early access but unfortunately this is something we are
          unable to arrange in advance. Cabin managers and maids are authorised to refuse entry until the
          scheduled access time therefore, to avoid any disappointment or embarrassment, we would kindly
          ask that you do not attempt to arrive any earlier than the time stated in your holiday pack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon arrival, if the client wishes to change the accommodation we do not accept any
          responsibility to offer alternative accommodation. However we shall endeavour to offer an
          alternative, but reserve the right to levy a charge for administration costs and any additional
          costs in offering the accommodation. We, through our agents shall notify the client of the
          alternative accommodation and any additional cost. In the event that the client accepts, the
          client shall pay such additional cost. In the event that payment is not made we reserve the
          right to withdraw the offer of alternative accommodation.
        </p>

        <h3>PETS, Animals, Insects</h3>
        <p>
          As in all countries which enjoy warm sunny climates, you may at certain times of the year
          experience problems with insects particularly with ants and mosquitoes. Ants — It is advisable
          that food or crumbs are not left out either in kitchens or deck or bedrooms as this attracts
          ants and/or other unwanted insects. At Sojourn Cabins, we aim to protect the environment. Please
          ensure rubbish is disposed in the correct type of bin so we can recycle where necessary.
          Mosquitoes are also prevalent at certain times of the year and you may need to take suitable
          precautions especially in the evenings and during the night.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We provide 24hrs security at our premises and will do all we can to ensure your safety while you
          stay with us. You do have the responsibility to lock your cabin door and lock up all your
          valuables in the safe provided. In the event of theft, report this to your Cabin Representative
          who will assist you with the local police. Be sure you obtain a police report covering the
          incident or loss, in order to make a claim on your holiday insurance. Please note we do not offer
          compensation resulting from activities of theft or accept any responsibility for such matters.
        </p>

        <h3>Use of Swimming Pools</h3>
        <p>
          The splash pool sizes in our descriptions are approximate and for guidance only. Some pools are
          irregular shaped and have been measured at the longest and widest points. Pools are maintained
          and cleaned on a regular basis. Please observe our strict no diving policy, as serious accidents
          can be caused. Sojourn Cabins will not accept any liability for any claims as a result of diving
          accidents. Do not run around the pool side, this especially applies to children with wet feet.
          Some areas may be slippery when wet. Heavy weather or thunderstorms can cause pools to turn
          cloudy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that the pool is a free standing pool made from flammable materials. Do not put
          candles or any items with open flames next to the pool. Also, be careful when drinking from
          breakable vessels while in the pool. In the event that you break any glass object, you must
          leave the pool immediately and report the incident to our representative for the pool to be
          drained and cleaned in order to avoid injury to you.
        </p>

        <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>
          Neither party shall be liable in damages or have the right to terminate this Agreement for any
          delay or default in performing hereunder if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond
          its control including, but not limited to Acts of God (for example: extreme weather conditions
          that restrict or cease travel arrangements, internet connection, television reception),
          Government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export or other necessary
          license), wars and acts of terrorism (including the cancellation of flights as a result thereof),
          insurrections and/or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party whose
          performance is affected, or the failure of third parties (such as suppliers and subcontractors)
          to perform their obligations to the contracting party. Whilst we do not exclude or limit our
          liability for loss or damage sustained by clients as a result of negligence by our employees /
          owners or agents, this cannot extend to actions/omissions by the agent over whom we have no
          direct control. Nevertheless, we will offer all reasonable assistance in the settlement of any
          dispute which may arise.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Supplies or Utilities</h3>
        <p>
          We accept no liability for failure of public supplies or utilities such as water, gas or
          electricity, satellite signal, internet connection/ Wi-Fi over which we have no control, nor of
          sewage systems, plumbing or mechanical equipment in cabins, but shall use our best endeavours to
          arrange prompt repairs where possible. Nor shall we accept responsibility for the failure of an
          owner, third party supplier or their employees to provide or deliver their service where we have
          no direct control over that supply of mechanical equipment or delivery or the monitoring of that
          service.
        </p>

        <h3>Death, Bodily Injury or Illness</h3>
        <p>
          We do not accept responsibility in respect of death, bodily injury or illness of, or to the
          signatory to the contract and/or any other named person on the booking form, except when caused
          by the negligent acts and/or omissions of our employees, agents, suppliers or, sub-contractors
          while acting within the scope of or in the course of their employment, agency, contract of
          supply or sub-contract. We shall afford every assistance to a client who through misadventure
          suffers illness, personal injury or death during the period of the holiday arising out of an
          activity which neither forms part of the foreign inclusive holiday arrangements nor forms part of
          an excursion offered through us. Such assistance shall take the form of advice, guidance and
          initial financial assistance.
        </p>

        <h3>Behaviour &amp; Duty of Care</h3>
        <p>
          We reserve the right in our absolute discretion to terminate your holiday or any holiday
          services without refund or compensation with immediate effect if your behaviour is likely, in
          our opinion or that of our employees, cabin Representatives or suppliers, to cause distress,
          damage, annoyance, noise/ loud music, obscene or lewd behaviour or danger to our employees or to
          any third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would normally apply where a very large group of persons seek to book which we feel may
          affect the enjoyment of other holidaymakers in the location or cause undue wear and tear to the
          property. No other persons are permitted to stay at the cabin other than those named on the
          booking form and under no circumstances may more than the maximum number of persons specified in
          the cabin description occupy/attend the property for any unauthorised celebration (except by
          prior written agreement with us). Breach of this clause will result in cancellation of your
          booking and/or eviction from the cabin and/or additional guests being asked to vacate and in this
          event you will not be entitled to a refund. We and our agents reserve the right of entry to the
          cabin at any time. You and all members of your party agree not to use or promote the property for
          any illegal or commercial purpose, including subletting, organised parties, photoshoots etc,
          breach of this clause will result in cancellation of your booking and you will not be entitled to
          a refund. An extra cleaning charge will be taken automatically from your damage deposit being
          held in the form of credit/debit/cash by Sojourn Cabins if it is deemed that unnecessary extra
          cleaning is required and caused through negligence / drunkenness and / or vandalism.
        </p>

        <h3>Weddings / Parties / Celebration Charges</h3>
        <p>
          No celebrations/parties/gatherings can be held at any of our properties without prior consent
          where it will/may be applicable to a charge for such an event at a rate determined by Sojourn
          Cabins in conjunction with the owner. It is a condition that in all our properties that hold
          wedding parties no live music may be booked to perform at our properties without prior written
          authority from Sojourn Cabins – Where any permission is given no live or recorded music must not
          continue after midnight. An immediate fine will be served by the local police if they are
          satisfied that the noise problem has exceeded this time. When guests are leaving please be
          considerate about others who live in the area. They are on holiday and may have young children
          trying to sleep. Remember, the later it gets, the quieter you should be. On departure all
          furniture inside or outside the property must put back in its original location please. Failure
          to do this can affect your damage deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should we ascertain proof of photographic evidence (to which the right of digital/personal
          data/copyright/data protection will be void) or otherwise that a wedding/celebration/gathering
          outside of the allocated number of persons allowed to stay at the property did occur without our
          consent we will/can automatically deduct said charge from the security/damage deposit being held
          in the form of credit/debit/cash by Sojourn Cabins. No guests other than those on the booking
          form can sleep at the property. Wedding celebration breakage deposits are to be paid via bank
          transfer/credit card/debit card with the balance of your cabin rental on the due date shown on
          your invoice and will be returned no later than 14 days from the date of departure stated on your
          invoice subject to zero damages/breakages/unlawful celebrations being reported.
        </p>

        <h3>Complaints and Correspondence</h3>
        <p>
          We hope that you enjoy your holiday and the services of Sojourn Cabins, but if you have any
          complaints, we want to rectify them as quickly as possible. It is our intention that any
          complaint is resolved quickly and to your satisfaction. Should you have any complaints / issues
          with your accommodation upon your arrival you must give Sojourn Cabins a reasonable amount of
          time to rectify / resolve any such issues. Should any clients of Sojourn Cabins vacate said
          property before Sojourn Cabins has had time to rectify any issues / complaints we will not be
          responsible for any costs of relocation or compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the unlikely event that you are still dissatisfied with any part of our services, our office
          team will ask you to record the details by way of photographs and forward these to our Ghana
          office by email or recorded delivery within 12 days of the complaint or latest, the return date
          of your holiday with us. Failure to give written notification sent by email / recorded delivery
          within 12 days of your complaint or latest from the return date of your holiday shall result in
          our not being liable for any loss or compensation whatsoever or howsoever arising. Sojourn
          Cabins will respond to your complaint within 14 days of receiving your recorded letter as a
          management report may be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can only correspond and accept complaints in written form from the Party Leader and are only
          able to correspond with the party leader due to the data protection act on any such matters
          relating to the booking. Similar or same properties may be advertised with other agents. Not
          giving Sojourn Cabins the option to book/relocate said property as an alternative option will
          cancel any option of refund/compensation. The Party Leader is the person or agency who holds the
          booking, to whom all correspondence and invoices are addressed and who is responsible for the
          rental. We cannot accept complaints from other members in the party. Our maximum liability to
          you if we are found to have been at fault in relation to the booking is limited to the
          commission we have earned or are due to earn in relation to the booking in question.
        </p>

        <h3>Building Works</h3>
        <p>
          There may be new building/renovation work taking place close to your cabin. We take steps to try
          and monitor this and advise you if any building work is likely to affect your cabin. Should we
          consider that a neighbouring building plot or plots would seriously affect your property with
          either noise or dust pollution or both, then we will use our reasonable endeavours to offer you
          an alternative from the Sojourn Cabins portfolio only. Where works or public works occur at short
          notice or without notice, and which are outside of our control, we cannot be held liable for any
          inconvenience to you, but we will ask the owners to compensate you, and if this is agreed, we
          will pass this on to you on behalf of the property owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          New building work starting after publication of individual cabin descriptions may in some way
          distort our description of the property we have considered peaceful or quiet. Building or road
          works may be in progress nearby, a neighbour may start building a swimming pool or wall, or the
          local water board may decide to drill for water in the vicinity. This work may start early in the
          morning as it is local practice and can start at any time in the year. As it is not always
          possible to gauge the extent of such works we regret we cannot advise you of the constantly
          changing conditions. If within 7 days of the start of your holiday we become aware of such works
          taking place on a plot immediately adjacent to your property (that is, an adjoining plot - not
          across the road or merely nearby) that in our opinion could materially spoil your enjoyment of
          your holiday we will advise you. You may then either a) cancel and receive a full refund for
          accommodation and car hire if the latter is booked with ourselves or b) change your booking to
          another available (subject to availability) cabin from Sojourn Cabins portfolio only for the same
          period either paying the difference if it is more expensive or receiving a refund if it is
          cheaper, or c) change your booking to another available cabin for a different period either
          paying the difference if it is more expensive or receiving a refund if it is cheaper or d) leave
          your reservation as it is and hope that there is not too much noise or dust to spoil your
          holiday. If you choose option (d), to stay with the reservation, it is extremely unlikely that
          after arrival we will be able to move you to any alternative accommodation if you suffer any
          inconvenience as described above, nor will any claim for compensation be accepted for any loss of
          enjoyment due to building or any other associated works within the vicinity of your holiday
          cabin. You should note that we are not responsible for such work, are not able to stop such work
          taking place nor control the noise level. Nor can we be responsible for any building works that
          start during a holiday and under no circumstances will we pay any compensation at all in such
          cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>
          This Agreement shall be governed and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of
          Ghana. The parties hereto submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ghanaian Courts and not
          outside of the Ghanaian courts. This applies to consumer claims that are made outside of the
          Ghanaian Courts and its jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          By completing and returning the Booking Form, you and all members of your party acknowledge full
          awareness of these Booking Terms &amp; Conditions and agree to accept and abide by the terms
          stated.
        </p>

        <h3>Condition of Cabin on Checkout</h3>
        <p>
          On departure you should leave the cabin in a reasonably clean and tidy condition so that it can
          be efficiently prepared for the next guests. If excess rubbish must be cleared or excessive
          cleaning of the cabin is necessary following your stay, any charges will either be: (a) deducted
          from your security deposit; or (b) invoiced to your postal address;
        </p>

        <h3>Pricing Errors</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the pricing information provided,
          regrettably errors may occasionally occur. When we become aware of any such error, we will
          endeavour to notify you at the time of booking (if we are then aware of the mistake), within 7
          days of the time of booking or as soon as reasonably possible. If a booking is already in place,
          you will have the choice to continue with the chosen itinerary at the corrected price or amend
          to a different holiday. We reserve the right to cancel the booking if you do not wish to accept
          the price that applies to your holiday or any quoted alternatives.
